# CNN Image Classification - FashionMNIST

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the FashionMNIST dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

FashionMNIST is a dataset of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, such as shirts, sneakers, and bags. This notebook walks through the process of:

- Loading and transforming the dataset
- Defining a custom CNN model
- Training and validating the model
- Evaluating performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix
